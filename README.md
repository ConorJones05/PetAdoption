# Pet Adoption Java Assignment

In this assignment you are a software developer for Stitterson Brooks pet adoption agency. Recently you all have had a flood of new pets come in and out of the shelter and you ahve been tasked with snsuring they all get the propper care.

To do this you are tasked with finishing the prevous devs cobebase So far all trhey had done was 
`Cat`, `Dog`, and `catImpl`. Not nealy enough.

## Task 1
Your first task is going to be to implemnt the Dog interface much like the `catImpl` file. You need to:
1. Build a contructor
2. Define all the Getter methods
3. Implemnt Bark which will print out `Bark!` when called.

## Task 2
This one will be harder than your last you will be incharge of finishing the `pound` class. This class controlls the feeding and regulates the happyness of the animals. 
You need to use `for` loops in this one hint `for int i = 0; i < x.length; i++`
1. First finish `dashboard` this methoid will itterate though all of the pets in the pound and print there name, age, hunger, and if they are happy or not.
2. Implemnt `feed` method. This methoid will require you to use the indexes from your dashboard and those who you send in will get food. You only have so much though so dont overfead those who dont need it.
3. Implemnt `happyfy` this method you will pass in the `name` of one of the animals and then use the setter method of that animal to witch then from sad to happy ie `true` to `false`
